## Overview

### The challenge

The Challenge was to build out a landing page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

It was possible to use any tools to complete the challenge.

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Bootstrap] (https://getbootstrap.com/) - Bootstrap framework

### What I learned

Good things during the project

- I've also build in this project a good HTML markup within a few hours
- In my opinion i wrote structured CSS-files with a bunch of useful variables
- The first time ever i've used more than one CSS-file and added indexes to them for a better structur
- I was persistent and worked on the project even there were heavy parts/days
- For the layout i needed to focus one the position properties so I learned a lot about :absolute and :relative
- Cause of the `<footer>` i needed to get deeper into flexbox properties so I learned about order: and flex-basis:

Doesn't match my expectations

- Farther i got some issues with
- - positioning and display the `<img>` esepecially the background-images,
- - matching the given design and
- - the hover-effect on the icons in the `<footer>`
- In the mobile-version the card-container doesn't fit the main-container
- - There is a black border on the left and right side
